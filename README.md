# Nashville-DataCleaning-SQL


This SQL data cleaning project aims to standardize the data format, populate missing property addresses, break out addresses into individual columns, change "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No" in the "Sold as Vacant" field, remove duplicates, and delete unused columns for the NashvilleHousing dataset. The readme provides the SQL queries used for each step of the cleaning process, resulting in a complete clean dataset.
